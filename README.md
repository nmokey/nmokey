# Ryan Zheng
## About me
I'm [Ryan Zheng](https://nmokey.com), a senior at Amador Valley High School (class of 2024). In my free time I like to play jazz piano, work on art projects in media such as charcoal, gouache, watercolor, and acrylic, and play with my dog Sky.
## Currently
I'm currently working on some webdev for a personal project called [Computer Vision with Cute Voles](https://www.nmokey.com/CVwithCV/) as well as a community service project for the [Yangon Grace Church](https://ygngracechurch.org/)!
## Previous projects
Previously worked as Software lead on the [NXP Hovergames Competition](https://github.com/nmokey/AVHovergames2023) in a team from Amador Valley High School.  
The paper from my [UT Austin internship](https://github.com/nmokey/UTAustinInternship) is also currently awaiting peer review and publication.
